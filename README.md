### Overview:
This web application runs a simple multiple-choice quiz. Quiz questions, choices, and answers are stored in constants.js. The quiz state is managed in quiz.jsx which contains the HTML for the user interface. The visual style such as fonts, colours, and backgrounds for each element are specified in index.scss, quiz.scss, and vars.scss. Future features planned to be implemented include user-inputted questions, different question formats, and a quiz timer.
